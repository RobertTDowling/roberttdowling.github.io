  <h1>Fun Things To Try</h1>
  <h2>Robot Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set atomic algorithm [picture]</li>
    <li>Play stretching time, pitch or scratch</li>
  </ul>
  The pitch of the Robot Voice changes with the size of grain.

  <h2>Sing-Song Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set smooth algorithm [picture]</li>
    <li>Scratch slowly or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p> Both the Robot and Sing-Song Voice are a direct result of size of the grains.
      In the case of the atomic algorithm, all the grains are the exact same size, 
      so when they are played back-to-back, the pitch corresponding to the
      grain size appears as a droning tone.  In the case of the smooth algorithm,
      the grains are not all the exact same size, and the small variations in length
      create similar variations in pitch which 
  
  <p>If the grain size corresponds to a pitch in the audible vocal range,
      300-3000Hz, it can sound like singing.
  
  <h2>Max Headroom</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain very large [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Scratch or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Scratching Ideas</h2>

  The scratch bar can be used in creative ways
  <ul>
    <li>Try to scratch forward at exactly the right speed to play normally</li>
    <li>Try to scratch backward as the same speed</li>
    <li>Put those together to get DJ FX</li>
    <li>Hold your finger on the scratch bar to get a sustained effect</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the grain size is small, it will be more of whistle or hum</li>
      <li>If the grain size is large, it will be more of a sample repetion effect</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hold you find on the scratch bar and roll it slightly left and right to get a vibrato effect between two
      pitches or samples</li>
    <li>Type typing on the scratch bar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Melody Ideas</h2>
    
    <p>The melody play [picture] works best with short samples less than 1/2 a second
        in length.

  <h2>Texture Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz) [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Experiment with atomic and smooth grain boundaries [picture goes here]</li>
    <li>Scratch or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  With a moderate grain size, very high grain repetition (big time stretches) give a slowly shifting texture used in 
  a lot of ambient music.
  
  <h2>Gender Changer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz) [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set smooth grain boundaries [picture goes here]</li>
    <li>Play shifting pitch [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  This effect does not work very well, but with small pitch shifts, you can imagine your words in other people's voices.
