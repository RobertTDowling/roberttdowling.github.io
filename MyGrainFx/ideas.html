  <h1>Fun Things To Try</h1>
  <h2>Robot Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set atomic algorithm [picture]</li>
    <li>Play stretching time, pitch or scratch</li>
  </ul>
  Robot pitch changes with size of grain

  <h2>Sing Song Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set smooth algorithm [picture]</li>
    <li>Scratch slowly or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  The "Singing" is caused by smooth algorithm, which chooses the closest natural grain boundaries to the target grain size.
  When the same grain is played over and over, for example, by scratching slowly, the natural length imparts a
  fundamenal frequency that you can hear.  
  If the grain size is in the audible vocal range, 300-3000Hz, it sounds like singing.
  
  <h2>Max Headroom</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain very large [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Scratch or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Scratching Ideas</h2>

  <h2>Melody Ideas</h2>
  The scratch bar can be used in creative ways
  <ul>
    <li>Try to scratch forward at exactly the right speed to play normally</li>
    <li>Try to scratch backward as the same speed</li>
    <li>Put those together to get DJ FX</li>
    <li>Hold your finger on the scratch bar to get a sustained effect</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the grain size is small, it will be more of whistle or hum</li>
      <li>If the grain size is large, it will be more of a sample repetion effect</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hold you find on the scratch bar and roll it slightly left and right to get a vibrato effect between two
      pitches or samples</li>
    <li>Type typing on the scratch bar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Texture Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz) [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Experiment with atomic and smooth grain boundaries [picture goes here]</li>
    <li>Scratch or play stretching time [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  With a moderate grain size, very high grain repetition (big time stretches) give a slowly shifting texture used in 
  a lot of ambient music.
  
  <h2>Gender Changer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz) [picture goes here] </li>
    <li>Set smooth grain boundaries [picture goes here]</li>
    <li>Play shifting pitch [picture]</li>
  </ul>
  This effect does not work very well, but with small pitch shifts, you can imagine your words in other people's voices.
