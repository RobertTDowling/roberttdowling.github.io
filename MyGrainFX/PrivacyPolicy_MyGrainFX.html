<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Robert Dowling built the MyGrainFX app as an ad-supported app. This
SERVICE is provided by Robert Dowling at no cost and is intended for
use as is.

<p>
This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies
with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if
anyone decided to use my Service.

<p>
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and
use of information in relation with this policy. I will not use or
share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
Policy.

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>
For a better experience while using our Service, I may require you to
provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including
but not limited to sounds recorded from the device microphone.

<p>
The information that I request is retained on your device and is not
collected by me in any way.

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>
I may employ third-party companies and individuals to provide
advertising content.  I want to inform users of this Service that
these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The
reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our
behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the
information for any other purpose.

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we
are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting
it. But remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure
and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>
The advertising presented in this Service may contain links to other
sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by
me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of
these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility
for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party
sites or services.

<h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>

<p>
This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children
under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided
me with personal information, I immediately delete this from my
servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
child has provided us with personal information, please
<a href="mailto:rpncalcn@gmail.com">contact me</a>
so that I will be able to do necessary actions.


<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will
notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted
on this page.

<h2>Contact Me</h2>

<p>
If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do
not hesitate to <a href="mailto:rpncalcn@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
