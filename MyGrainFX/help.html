<h1>MyGrainFX Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>MyGrainFX uses <b>Granular Synthesis</b> to make wonderful sounds
from your own voice recordings.  It uses different ways to chop up the
recordings into little segments called sound <b>grains.</b>  Grains are larger than
the digital samples normally manipulated by computers.  Each grain
is like a little chunk of audio, long enough to have particular, unique sound,
but short enough that adding or removing one here or there does not disturb the overall
continuity of the recoding.
    

<h2>Granular Syntesis</h2>
    
<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=granular+synthesis">google Granular Synthesis</a>
   you will find hundreds of articles on the subject.

<p>Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis">
   Wikipedia article</a> on Granular Synthesis.

<h2>The Controls</h2>

  <hr>
  <h3> Recording Controls</h3>
    <img src="images/record_bar.png" width=90% border=1> 
    <p>
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_rec.png" width=24> 
    Record up to 5 seconds from the microphone
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_stop.png" width=24> 
    Stop recording, or stop any playback
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_play.png" width=24> 
    Playback normally
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_play2.png" width=24> 
    Playback at half speed
    
    <p>Below the controls is the recording length in 1/1000 seconds (ms).
      In the image above, the recording is 1.76 seconds.

    <p>When recording starts, most of the controls are replaced with a
    microphone

  <h3>Grain Type and Size Controls</h3>
    <img src="images/grain_size_ctrls.png" width=90% border=1> 
    <p>
    
    <br><img src="images/atom_algorithm.png" width=100> 
    Select the <b>Atomic</b> type: grains are all of equal length
    
    <br><img src="images/smooth_algorithm.png" width=100> 
    Select the <b>Smooth</b> type: grains have different lengths and sound smoother together
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_music.png" width=24> 
    Play a little melody
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_playrand.png" width=24> 
    Play grains randomly while holding down

    <p><img src="images/grain_size_3ms.png" width=75%> 
    <br>Change size of grains. The size of the grains is shown above in ms and frequency in Hz. 
    
    <p>Note: Changing the size of the grains when the Smooth
    algorithm is selected can take a long time, so the size
    updates only when you release the control.

  <h3>Grain Repeating Effects</h3>
    <img src="images/grain_count_ctrls.png" width=90% border=1> 
    <p>
      
    <br><img src="images/ic_time.png" width=24> 
    Play stretching time
    
    <br><img src="images/ic_music_note.png" width=24> 
    Play shifting pitch

    <p><img src="images/grain_count_2.png" width=75%> 
    <br>Control time stretch or pitch shift by repeating or dropping grains.
        Move the control to the left speed up or raise the pitch, to the right to slow down or lower the pitch.
    

 <h3>Scratch Bar and Graph</h3>

    <p><img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=50%> 

    <br>Touch and hold anywhere on graph to play grains.  Move left and right to "scratch"
    like a DJ.
      
<h2>Tips for Better Recordings</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid having silence at start or end of recoding.  Start talking right away and be ready to hit stop as soon as you can.
        <li>Make sure you talk as loud as you would on the phone:
          not so loud that you distort, and not so quiet you can't be heard.
    </ul>

<h1><a id="ideas">Fun Things To Try</a></h1>
  <h2>Robot Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small, around 3ms</li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_size_3ms.png" width=75%>
    <li>Set atomic algorithm</li>
      <br><img src="images/atom_algorithm.png" width=30%>
    <li>Play
      <img src="images/ic_time.png" width=7%> stretching time,
      <img src="images/ic_music_note.png" width=7%> shifting pitch or
      <br><img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=30%> scratching</li>
  </ul>
  The pitch of the Robot Voice changes with the size of grain.

  <h2>Sing-Song Voice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain size small, around 3ms </li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_size_3ms.png" width=75%>
    <li>Set smooth algorithm</li>
      <br><img src="images/smooth_algorithm.png" width=30%>
    <li><img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=30%> Scratch slowly or
      <br>play <img src="images/ic_time.png" width=7%> stretching time</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p> Both the Robot and Sing-Song Voice are a direct result of grain size.
      Atomic grains are all the same size, 
      so when they are played back-to-back, the pitch corresponding to the
      grain size sounds as a droning tone.  Smooth grains are not all
      the same size, and the small variations in length
      create similar variations in pitch which "sings" when played.
  
  <h2>CD Skip Glitch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain very large
      <br><img src="images/grain_size_80ms.png" width=75%>
    <li>Set the grain count high</li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_count_5.png" width=75%>
    <li><img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=30%> Scratch or
      <br>play <img src="images/ic_time.png" width=7%> stretching time</li>
  </ul>
  
  Playback will repeat segments over and over like a CD skipping.
    
  <h2>Scratching Ideas</h2>

  <img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=30%><br>
  The scratch bar can be used in creative ways
  <ul>
    <li>Try to scratch forward at exactly the right speed to play normally</li>
    <li>Try to scratch backward as the same speed</li>
    <li>Put those together to get DJ FX</li>
    <li>Hold your finger on the scratch bar to get a sustained effect</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the grain size is small, it will be more of whistle or hum</li>
      <li>If the grain size is large, it will be more of CD skip effect</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Hold you find on the scratch bar and roll it slightly left and right to get a vibrato effect between two
      pitches or samples</li>
     <ul>
      <li>Roll slowly</li>
      <li>Roll quickly</li>
    </ul>
   <li>Type "typing" on the scratch bar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Melody Tip</h2>
    
  <p>The melody play <img src="images/ic_music.png" width=7%>
    works best with short samples less than 1/2 a second in length.

  <h2>Texture Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz)</li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_size_20ms.png" width=75%>
    <li>Set the grain count high</li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_count_5.png" width=75%>
    <li>Experiment with
      <br><img src="images/atom_algorithm.png" width=30%> atomic and
      <br><img src="images/smooth_algorithm.png" width=30%> smooth
      grain boundaries</li>
    <li>Play
      <img src="images/ic_time.png" width=7%> stretching time, or
      <br><img src="images/scratchbar.png" width=30%> scratching</li>
    
  </ul>
  With a moderate grain size, very high grain repetition (big time stretches) give a slowly shifting texture used in 
  a lot of ambient music.
  
  <h2>Gender Changer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the grain around 20ms (50Hz)</li>
      <br><img src="images/grain_size_20ms.png" width=75%>
    <li>Set
      <img src="images/smooth_algorithm.png" width=30%>
      smooth grain boundaries</li>
    <li>Play 
      <img src="images/ic_music_note.png" width=7%>
      shifting pitch</li>
  </ul>
  This effect does not work as well as some of the others,
  but with small pitch shifts, you can imagine your words in other voices.
